# Pharaoh (js)

The game [Pharaoh](https://www.gog.com/en/game/pharaoh_cleopatra) is my favourite city builder game of all time.

I thought it would be a cool project to make a browser game based largely on it.

Webapp made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), with
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) as the bundler
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for easy premade styling

There are no game or graphics libraries used, just vanilla TS and the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

The graphics are currently all done in MS Paint by me :smile:
